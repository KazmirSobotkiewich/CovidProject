## Looking at Covid Data with SQL

### 1. Dataset
The data is taken from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and then seperated placed into CovidDeaths.xlsx and CovidVaccinations.xlsx

### 2. Data Import
The data is imported into an SQL database by choosing the .xlsx files as the data source and choosing "Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server" as the destination

### 3. SQL Queries
SQL queries are written in the SQL script file, given information such as:

* Percentage of the population that is vaccinated against Covid
* Overall Covid death rate estimate
* Countires/Continents with highest death count per population
* Countries with highest infection rate per population
* etc

### 4. Data Visualization
Next step is to create an aesthetic Tableau dashboard to present the above information
